###Block explorer

To operate under your coin.
Just change the connection information in config.js

The coins total value also inside of pages/home.html

This works under Apache1 and Apache2
with php7.0 and php7.3

Running under Nginx will have issues ,will not run under
Nginx straight out of the box.

### Note:
