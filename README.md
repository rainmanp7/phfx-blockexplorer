###Block explorer

To operate under your coin.
Just change the connection information in config.js

The coins total value also inside of pages/home.html

This works under Apache1 and Apache2
with php7.0 and php7.3

Running under Nginx will have issues ,will not run under
Nginx straight out of the box.

It will be a total value times etc...
To find your correct emissions rate ,this must be modified

Make sure you have curl installed on linux.
Apache2 curl mod installed.
