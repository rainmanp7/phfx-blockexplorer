### Block explorer

To operate under your coin.
Just change the connection information in config.js

The coins total value also inside of pages/home.html

This works under Apache1 and Apache2
with php7.0 and php7.3

Running under Nginx will have issues ,will not run under
Nginx straight out of the box.

### Note:
<br>
Your coin value will need to be modified inside the webpage.
<br>
It will be a total value times etc... *
<br>
To find your correct emissions rate ,this must be modified
<br>
Make sure you have curl installed on linux.
Apache2 curl mod installed.
<br>
Curl will need to be enabled in php settings ini file.
<br>
Uncomment and reset the service to continue.
<br>
Please don't forget to clear your browsers cache as well.
